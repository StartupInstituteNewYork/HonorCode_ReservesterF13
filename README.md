# Reservester

This is my lab project for Startup Institute (Oct - December 2013). It is an open table clone featuring restaurants that do not exist but really, really should. It lives on Heroku [here]  (http://myreservester.herokuapp.com) and I will be adding to it as I make progress in building out each feature.

Reservester was made with **Rails 4.0** and **Ruby 2.0.0** in the golden autumn of 2013.

Gems and specs so far:
* Carrierwave for images
* Devise for authentication and owner model
* Bootstrap responsive design
* Client-side validation with Parsely JS

OK
